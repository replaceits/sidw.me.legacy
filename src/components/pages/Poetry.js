          Something clicks in your head<br />
          And suddenly everything’s easily read<br />
          The words speak true<br />
          But only just to you<br />
          Connections start to form<br />
          And you finally clear the storm<br />
          Looking at the divine<br />
          This is your sign<br />
          Take your calling given<br />
          You’ve already risen
